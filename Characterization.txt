Those who can find or make peace in the chaotic world around them have everything.
I've seen what fame can bring. And I'll do anything to get all that for myself.
Hard work, sacrifice, and training lead to successâ€”and eventually to perfection.
I want to be successful. And alone. With lots of guards and wards between me and everyone else in the world.
Material wealth is an illusion. Wisdom is the real treasure.
While my parent was out adventuring, a servant raised me, and I care about that person more than anyone.
I consider every member of my parent's former adventuring party to be family.
Despite their absences, my famous parent was kind and generous. I love them and want to make them proud.
My childhood home holds all my best memories, and its upkeep is my primary concern.
Growing up, I had an imaginary friend I could always count on. That friend is still with me.
You don't know what I'm going through. You never can.
You. Fetch my cloak. And maybe rub my feet for a while.
My comrades are brave, but I must defeat this threat alone to prove my worth.
Oh, yeah, that tool? Named after my parent's best friend. Let me tell you about them.
My best days are behind me. Ahead lies only toil, pain, and death.
You have to look out for yourself. No one else will.
I'm good at hiding my true thoughts and feelings.
When I'm in doubt about revealing something, I assume it's a secret, and I don't share it.
I like to sound mysterious, because wisdom hidden grows deeper with time.
I have no patience with people who get in my way.
I love hearing about other people's nightmares.
Combat is meant to be quick, clean, and one-sided.
I like to stick to the shadows.
I never show my anger. I just plot my revenge.
My true guild is all that really matters.
I like pulling the strings.
I collect secrets and never reveal them.
I want to know as much as I can about this city and how it works.
I value the freedom to pursue my own goals without interference.
I don't believe in anything, and anyone who does is a fool.
I discovered a secret I can't let anyone else uncoverâ€”including my guild superiors.
I formed a close friendship or romance with someone in the guild I'm infiltrating.
I spend as much time as I can in the Great Library because I'm certain an information hub operates behind its facade. I want its secrets!
I'm utterly loyal to my superior in the guild, more than to the guild or its guildmaster.
Someone has discovered my true identity.
I like secrets so much that I'm reluctant to share details of a plan even with those who need to know.
I would let my friends die rather than reveal my true identity.
I have trouble trusting anyone but myself.
I have a particular vice that puts all my secrets at risk if I'm not careful.
I'm pretty sure I've done something horrible that I can't remember because of the guild's mind magic.
I put too much trust in the people who give me orders.
I'm earnest and uncommonly direct.
I strive to have no personalityâ€”it's easier to forget what's hardly there.
I treasure a memento of the person or instance that set me upon my path.
I sleep just as much as I need to and on an unusual schedule.
I think far ahead, a detachedness often mistaken for daydreaming.
I cultivate a single obscure hobby or study and eagerly discuss it at length.
I am ever learning how to be among othersâ€”when to stay quiet, when to laugh.
I behave like an extreme opposite of my persona.
Place in society shouldn't determine one's access to what is right.
Doing what must be done can't bring the innocent to harm.
Deception is a weapon. Strike from where your foes won't expect.
My name will be a malediction, a curse that fulfills my will.
Be a symbol, and leave your flawed being behind.
It's my deeds that should be remembered, not their instrument.
I do everything for my family. My first thought is keeping them safe.
What I do, I do for the world. The people don't realize how much they need me.
I've seen too many in need. I must not fail them as everyone else has.
I stand in opposition, lest the wicked go unopposed.
I am exceptional. I do this because no one else can, and no one can stop me.
I do everything for those who were taken from me.
I am callous about death. It comes to us all eventually.
I never make eye contact or hold it unflinchingly.
I have no sense of humor. Laughing is uncomfortable and embarrassing.
I overexert myself, sometimes needing to recuperate for a day or more.
I see morality entirely in black and white.
I didn't have the cutthroat attitude necessary to succeed. I won't make that mistake again.
Even my competitors said I was affable and talented. Those traits should serve me well.
To prosper, you have to be in control.
The customer is always right.
I was cutting corners and breaking deals to maximize profit. That's why I failed.
When I get an idea, I am single-minded in its executionâ€”even if it's a terrible idea.
If I can be everyone's friend, I'll always have support.
Where there's life, there's hope. If I remain alive and flexible, I can succeed.
People helped me when I was down. Now that I'm back on my feet, I'll pay it forward.
Caution got me nowhere in my previous business. I'm not going to let it hold me back now.
With enough coin, I can buy comfort, power, knowledge, and even eternal life. Nothing will stand between me and money.
Too many people consider me a failure. So I need to prove them wrong.
My family means everything to me. I failed them before, and I must not do so again.
My former business partner fell ill, and then our business failed. Part of my new venture involves earning enough to take care of their family.
If I take care of my possessions, they'll take care of me. People come and go, but a tool is something you can always rely on.
Although my business failed, the people of my community were kind to me. I'll do everything in my power to protect them.
I owe a dangerous person a lot of money. As long as they're happy, they let my debt rest unpaid.
Why spend gold here when you can buy the same thing for copper in the next town?
I must have the best of everything. Like, right now.
You haven't heard of me? I'm sure that's because of your ignorance and low breeding.
I failed, but I'm awesome. So when anyone else is successful, it must be because of nepotism, dishonesty, or dumb luck.
I find that most people are trustworthy. Hey, where's my belt pouch?
I have different assumptions from those around me concerning personal space, blithely invading others' space in innocence, or reacting to ignorant invasion of my own.
I have my own ideas about what is and is not food, and I find the eating habits of those around me fascinating, confusing, or revolting.
I have a strong code of honor or sense of propriety that others don't comprehend.
I express affection or contempt in ways that are unfamiliar to others.
I begin or end my day with small traditional rituals that are unfamiliar to those around me.
I have much to learn from the kindly folk I meet along my way.
As someone new to these strange lands, I am cautious and respectful in my dealings.
I'm far from home, and everything is strange and wonderful!
Though I may not know their ways, neither do they know mine, which can be to my advantage.
Everything is new, but I have a thirst to learn.
I must be careful, for I have no way of telling friend from foe here.
So long as I have this token from my homeland, I can face any adversity in this strange land.
I hold no greater cause than my service to my people.
My freedom is my most precious possession. I'll never let anyone take it from me again.
I'm fascinated by the beauty and wonder of this new land.
Though I had no choice, I lament having to leave my loved one(s) behind. I hope to see them again one day.
I am secretly (or not so secretly) convinced of the superiority of my own culture over that of this foreign land.
I pretend not to understand the local language in order to avoid interactions I would rather not have.
I have a weakness for the new intoxicants and other pleasures of this land.
I don't take kindly to some of the actions and motivations of the people of this land, because these folks are different from me.
I have a weakness for the exotic beauty of the people of these lands.
Like a nomad, I can't settle down in one place for very long.
Good music makes me weep like a baby.
Wherever I go, I try to bring a little of the warmth and tranquility of home with me.
I have never lost my childlike sense of wonder.
When I have a new idea, I get wildly excited about it until I come up with another, better idea.
I live by my own set of weird and wonderful rules.
I can't bring myself to trust most adults.
I never leave a friend behind
No creature should be made to suffer.
I prefer to take the less traveled path.
Change is good, which is why I live by an ever-changing set of rules.
A deal is a deal, and I would never break one.
Everything happens in threes. I see the "rule of three" everywhere.
I won't let go of a grudge.
I will do whatever it takes to get what I want, regardless of the harm it might cause.
I would never break my word.
I do what I can to protect the natural world.
A trusted friend is the most important thing in the world to me.
I easily lose track of time. My poor sense of time means I'm always late.
I think the whole world is out to get me.
I'm always operating under a tight timeline, and I'm obsessed with keeping everything on schedule.
I'm a kleptomaniac who covets shiny, sparkling treasure.
I'm forgetful. Sometimes I can't remember even the simplest things.
I never give away anything for free and always expect something in return.
I have many vices and tend to indulge them.
I'm always changing my mindâ€”well, almost always.
I am unmoved by the wrath of nature.
My friends are my crew; we sink or float together.
I need long stretches of quiet to clear my head.
Rich folk don't know the satisfaction of hard work.
I laugh heartily, feel deeply, and fear nothing.
I work hard; nature offers no handouts.
I dislike bargaining; state your price and mean it.
Luck favors me, and I take risks others might not.
Good people make even the longest voyage bearable.
Our luck depends on respecting its rulesâ€”now throw this salt over your shoulder.
The richest bounty goes to those who risk everything.
Take all that you can and leave nothing for the scavengers.
Do not fish the same spot twice in a row; suppress your greed, and nature will reward you.
No wave can move a soul hard at work.
I lost something important in the deep sea, and I intend to find it.
Someone else's greed destroyed my livelihood, and I will be compensated.
I will fish the many famous waters of this land.
I must repay my village's debt.
I am judgmental, especially of those I deem homebodies or otherwise lazy.
I become depressed and anxious if I'm away from the sea too long.
I have lived a hard life and find it difficult to empathize with others.
I am inclined to tell long-winded stories at inopportune times.
I work hard, but I play harder.
I am obsessed with catching an elusive aquatic beast, often to the detriment of other pursuits.
I plan for every contingency. Leave nothing to chance!
Every copper wants to be a silver. Each bet is an opportunity.
I'm one of Lady Luck's favored. Anything I try is destined to succeed.
I've lost so much to gambling that I refuse to spend money on anything anymore.
Nothing is certain. Planning is a coward's act.
I can't be sure who I've swindled, cheated, or defeated, so I keep a low profile in public.
The perfect bet is out there somewhere. I just have to keep my eyes open.
I have beaten my addiction, but all it takes is one weak moment and I'll be back at the card table.
Knowledge is power, and knowing which horse to back is the key to success.
Whatever happens is fated, regardless of any planning or striving.
If you want to succeed, you have to take risks.
You can't win if you're dead. Live to fight another dayâ€”when the odds might be more in your favor.
When I was in need, I was able to rely on others. Now I want to be the one others rely on.
Winning is the real measure of a person. In the end, the only thing that matters is the scoreboard.
One person in particular owes me a lot of money, and I need to keep them alive if I want to be repaid.
I'm loyal to the friend or family member who taught me how to gamble.
The person who saved me from my gambling addiction is the only reason I'm alive today.
A patron once fronted me money in exchange for a percentage of my winnings. I owe them a debt of gratitude. And a lot of cash.
A criminal syndicate I once played for isn't happy I left the game, and its enforcers are looking for me.
Urchins once helped me find marks for my games. Now I'm driven to help them escape the streets.
I don't know when to quit. Especially when everyone else is telling me to.
I save my sympathy for my friends, and I have no friends.
You think we're in trouble now? Let me tell you how bad things are likely to get!
You can loan me a little, right? I've got a sure thing. I'll double your money, guaranteed.
I was once a terribly flawed person, like you. Let me tell you how you can save yourself.
I'm a great gambler. I'm just bad at math and logic.
Remember, I could kill you in your sleep. Or put centipedes in your bedroll.
I like to remind people of their inevitable demise.
I do my best to discourage anyone from approaching or talking to me.
I have accepted my death. Hence, I don't fear it.
Like roots growing through stone, I am relentless and determined in my action.
I put my knowledge of anatomy to use by narrating the injuries my enemies suffer in grisly detail.
Like a wild animal, I lash out viciously when I'm provokedâ€”and I'm easily provoked.
All of us are part of the cyclical march of nature, which will continue with or without us.
The natural world is more important than the edifices of the city and civilization.
We are all part of nature's web.
Meddling in the affairs of other guilds is a great way to get squashed like a bug.
I have an identical twin who is as different from me as any person could be.
I want to lead one faction of the guild to a new position of dominance.
I found something in the sewer that must never come to light.
I am forever grateful to the one who found me floating facedown in the sewer, moments from death.
Death comes for us all, so you can't expect me to take care of someone who can't fight it off.
I feel a need for revenge against those who enjoy the privilege of living above ground.
I don't bother to couch my opinions in flattering words.
I can't help but pocket any trinket or coin I come across, no matter how worthless.
I'm convinced that I'm better and stronger than members of other guilds, isolated as they are from the realities of life and death.
I love the spotlight. Everyone, look at me!
Give me a drink and I'm your friend.
Talk to me about yourself. I'm a hell of a listener.
I hate to start fights, but I love to finish them.
I can't sit still.
I'm always humming an old tune from my past.
When I don't have a reason to smile, I'm miserable.
I'm lucky like you wouldn't believe.
Tyrants must fall, no matter the cost.
The only way to make a better world is to perform small kindnesses.
A nation built upon just foundations will uphold freedom for all.
Music, joy, and laughter are the keys to freedom.
People should be free to do as they please.
A free people must be carefully taught, lest they be misled.
Music helped me through a dark time in my life. Now, I'll use music to change the world.
I will be known as the greatest spy who ever lived.
All life is precious to me. I know I can change the world without taking a life.
The elite in their ivory towers don't understand how we suffer. I intend to show them.
I've never lied once in my life. What? No, I'm not crossing my fingers!
I do everything big! Subtlety? I don't know the meaning of subtlety! Oh, that's a problem?
I can't focus on my mission. I just want to carouse and sing and play!
I can't afford to trust anyone. Not. Anyone.
Unlike people, the beasts of the wild are friends who won't stab me in the back.
Go ahead and insult meâ€”I dare you.
I scorn those who can't survive away from the comforts of the city.
Don't tell me I'm not allowed to do something.
Laws are for people who are afraid to face their inner beasts.
I smear the blood of my enemies over my skin.
HarrRRAAGGHH! [I rarely form a coherent sentence and prefer to express myself by breaking things.]
My clan is all that really matters.
No person or law or custom can tell another what to do.
We weren't born tame or domesticated, so we shouldn't have to live that way.
The strongest are meant to dominate the weak.
The Old Ways must be preserved and upheld.
I am determined that one day I will lead my clanâ€”or a new one.
I would give my life for my clan chieftain.
The chieftain of another clan has a grudge against me.
I am devoted to a sacred site in the midst of the rubblebelt.
My weapon is made from the first beast I ever hunted.
If you question my courage, I will never back down.
My anger in battle led to the death of a loved one.
I'm as stubborn as any beast.
I'm so convinced of my superiority over soft, civilized people that I'll take great risks to prove it.
I'm easily manipulated by people I find attractive.
I desperately need to get back to someone or someplace, but I lost them in the Mists.
Everything I do is in the service of a powerful master, one I must keep a secret from everyone.
I owe much to my vanished mentor. I seek to continue their work even as I search to find them.
I've seen great darkness, and I'm committed to being a light against itâ€”the light of all lights.
Someone I love has become a monster, murderer, or other threat. It's up to me to redeem them.
The world has been convinced of a terrible lie. It's up to me to reveal the truth.
I deeply miss someone and am quick to adopt people who remind me of them.
A great evil dwells within me. I will fight against it and the world's other evils for as long as I can.
I'm desperately seeking a cure to an affliction or a curse, either for someone close to me for myself.
Spirits are drawn to me. I do all I can to help them find peace.
I use my cunning mind to solve mysteries and find justice for those who've been wronged.
I lost someone I care about, but I still see them in guilty visions, recurring dreams, or as a spirit.
I believe doom follows me and that anyone who gets close to me will face a tragic end.
I'm convinced something is after me, appearing in mirrors, dreams, and places where no one could.
I'm especially superstitious and live life seeking to avoid bad luck, wicked spirits, or the Mists.
I've done unspeakable evil and will do anything to prevent others from finding out.
I am exceptionally credulous and believe any story or legend immediately.
I'm a skeptic and don't believe in the power of rituals, religion, superstition, or spirits.
I know my future is written and that anything I do will lead to a prophesied end.
I need to find the best in everyone and everything, even when that means denying obvious malice.
I've seen the evil of a type of placeâ€”like forests, cities, or graveyardsâ€”and resist going there.
I'm exceptionally cautious, planning laboriously and devising countless contingencies.
I have a reputation for defeating a great evil, but that's a lie and the wicked force knows.
I know the ends always justify the means and am quick to make sacrifices to attain my goals.
I had an encounter that I believe gives me a special affinity with a supernatural creature or event.
A signature piece of clothing or distinct weapon serves as an emblem of who I am.
I never accept that I'm out of my depth.
I must know the answer to every secret. No door remains unopened in my presence.
I let people underestimate me, revealing my full competency only to those close to me.
I compulsively seek to collect trophies of my travels and victories.
It doesn't matter if the whole world's against me. I'll always do what I think is right.
I have morbid interests and a macabre aesthetic.
I have a personal ritual, mantra, or relaxation method I use to deal with stress.
Nothing is more important than life, and I never leave anyone in danger.
I'm quick to jump to extreme solutions. Why risk a lesser option not working?
I'm easily startled, but I'm not a coward.
I've experienced such strangeness that now I feel alive only in extreme situations.
I strive to counter the deeds of someone for whom I feel responsible.
I've wronged someone and must work their will to avoid their curse.
I believe there is something beyond the world I know, and I need to find it.
I must do something great so that I'm remembered, and my time is running out.
I work vigorously to keep others from realizing my flaws or misdeeds.
I've lived this way for so long that I can't imagine another way.
I owe it to my people, faith, family, or teacher to continue a vaunted legacy.
My life is no longer my own. I must fulfill the dream of someone who's gone.
I need to know what lies beyond the mysteries of death, the world, or the Mists.
I know the forces at work in the world and strive to create islands apart from them.
I care about the truth above all else, even if it doesn't benefit anyone.
A monster that slaughtered dozens of innocent people spared your life, and you don't know why.
You were born under a dark star. You can feel it watching you, coldly and distantly. Sometimes it beckons you in the dead of night.
An apparition that has haunted your family for generations now haunts you. You don't know what it wants, and it won't leave you alone.
Your family has a history of practicing the dark arts. You dabbled once and felt something horrible clutch at your soul, whereupon you fled in terror.
You did terrible things to avenge the murder of someone you loved. You became a monster, and it haunts your waking dreams.
I'm always looking to improve efficiency.
I love to share trivia about my house's business.
I never forget an insult against me or my house.
I'm enthusiastic about everything my house does.
I represent my house and take pride in my looks.
My house serves a vital function, and its prosperity will help everyone.
I uphold the traditions of my house and bring honor to my family.
Abandon old traditions and find better ways to do things.
I want to ensure the prosperity of my house and wield its power myself.
I want to learn all I can, both for my house and for my own curiosity.
I want to ensure that me and mine enjoy the best things in life.
My house is my family. I would do anything for it.
I love someone from another house, but the relationship is forbidden.
Someone I love was killed by a rival faction within my house, and I will have revenge.
I don't care about the house as a whole, but I would do anything for my old mentor.
I'm determined to impress the leaders of my house, and to become a leader myself.
I'm fixated on following official protocols.
My secret could get me expelled from my house.
I'm working for a hidden faction in my house that gives me secret assignments.
I have a hard time staying focused on... oh, and my brain tends to jump from one... did I mention focus?
I get really excited about my ideas and I can't wait to talk about them and start putting them into practice and tinkering with them and I want to tell you about how exciting it all is!
Life's an experiment, and I can't wait to see what happens.
I pepper my speech with the incomprehensible jargon of my trade, like mizzium droplets inserted into a weird-field suspension.
Great ideas are fine, but great results are what counts.
If you can guess what I'm about to do, that means I've run out of imagination.
Half the world's troubles come from stodgy thinking, stuck in the past. We need innovative solutions.
Every experiment has the potential to reveal more secrets of the world.
A rigorous application of logical principles and protocols will lead us toward progress more surely than any belief system.
I love my job! Despite the dangerous working conditions, there's nothing I'd rather do.
I have dedicated my life to finding a solution to a scientific problem.
I'll never forget the laboratory where I learned my skills, or the other attendants who learned alongside me.
I'm convinced it was sabotage that destroyed my first laboratory and killed many of my friends, and I seek revenge against whoever did it.
I have the schematics for an invention that I hope to build one day, once I have the necessary resources.
A fellow student and I are racing to solve the same scientific puzzle.
I would do anything the guildmaster told me to do.
If there's a plan, I'll probably forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll probably ignore it.
I get bored easily, and if nothing is happening I'll make something happen.
Nothing is ever simple, and if it seems simple, I'll find a way to make it complicated.
I tend to ignore sleep for days when I'm conducting research, often at the expense of my own health and safety.
I'm incapable of admitting a flaw in my logic.
I thrive on esoteric lore. The more obscure the historical references I can include in everyday conversation, the better.
By searching for these lost artifacts, I hope to find who I really am along the way.
I can barely go a minute without talking about my research. I have so much knowledge in my head, and it needs to be let out somewhere!
The spirits of the dead are so much more interesting to talk with than living classmates.
I can speak eloquently about the historical ramifications of an ancient war. But ask me to add two-digit numbers together, and I'm a mess.
In the end, it's all just entropy. Everything falls apart someday.
I speak rarely but mean every word I say.
I laugh loudly and see the humor in stressful situations.
I prefer to solve problems without violence, but I finish fights decisively.
I enjoy being out in nature; poor weather never sours my mood.
I am dependable.
I am always working on some project or other.
I become cantankerous and quiet in the rain.
When the sea is within my sight, my mood is jovial and optimistic.
Success depends on cooperation and communication.
The marines' code provides a solution for every problem, and following it is imperative.
Life is messy. Throwing yourself into the worst of it is necessary to get the job done.
The strong train so that they might rule those who are weak.
To act when others quake in fearâ€”this is the essence of the warrior.
No injury or obstacle can turn me from my goal.
I face danger and evil to offset an unredeemable act in my past.
I. Will. Finish. The. Job.
I must set an example of hope for those who have given up.
I'm searching for a fellow marine captured by an elusive enemy.
Fear leads to tyranny, and both must be eradicated.
My commander betrayed my unit, and I will have revenge.
I grow combative and unpredictable when I drink.
I find civilian life difficult and struggle to say the right thing in social situations.
My intensity can drive others away.
I hold grudges and have difficulty forgiving others.
I become irrational when innocent people are hurt.
I sometimes stay up all night listening to the ghosts of my fallen enemies.
I am always willing to act in accordance with the financial incentive offered.
Debts are never meant to be forgiven.
I am accustomed to enjoying the finest pleasures money can buy.
No one could doubt that I am a cut above the masses of pitiful peasants that infest the city.
I can't stand to spend a bit more than necessary to purchase what I need.
I hate it when people try to make light of a serious situation.
I want to make sure everyone is aware of how wealthy, powerful, and important I am.
I can't think of anything to look forward to.
I will do whatever it takes to become as rich as the oligarchs.
One day, I will be the one giving orders.
I want to be admired, respected, feared, or even hated for my position and wealth.
The economy functions best when chaos is kept under control and everyone knows their place.
I want to live foreverâ€”in the flesh as long as possible, and as a spirit afterward.
The unbearable weight of my debt has driven me to desperation.
I value my worldly goods more highly than my mortal life.
An oligarch publicly humiliated me, and I will exact revenge on that whole family.
I want to prove myself more worthy than an older sibling and thereby ensure that I inherit a greater share of my parents' wealth.
I'm convinced that everyone I know is plotting against me.
I'll brave any risk if the monetary reward is great enough.
I am convinced that I am far more important than anyone else is willing to acknowledge.
I have little respect for anyone who isn't wealthy.
I'll take any opportunity to steal from wealthier people, even for worthless trinkets.
I'm the life of the party, and I expect everyone's attention when I walk into a room.
Two weeks ago, I was enthralled with my latest project. Now, I think it's garbage and deserves to be destroyed.
I believe everyone has the ability to express their truest selves through art, and I'm happy to quietly push them in the right direction.
Everyone is a critic, and I work to win them all over.
I'm beset with such an overwhelming sense of ennui regarding my art. Nothing quite captures my attention anymore.
Instead of confronting my negative emotions, I channel them into explosive artistic displays.
When I find a subject I'm interested in, I won't stop studying until I know everything about it. It keeps me up at night.
I hope this all makes sense to me one day. Until then, I'm going to keep faking it.
Equations and patterns come naturally to my mind. I wish friendship came just as easily.
I believe I'm always the smartest person in the room. And I'll prove it, even if no one asks me to.
If life has taught me anything, it's that reality is a lie, and nothing matters. So why bother?
Before I move on, I want to achieve something mathematically impossible. I must leave a legacy!
I revel in mayhem, the more destructive the better.
When violence breaks out, I lose myself in rage, and it's sometimes hard to stop.
Everything is funny to me, and the most hilarious and bloodiest things leave me cackling with sadistic glee.
I derive genuine pleasure from the pain of others.
I enjoy testing other people's patience.
I can't stand it when things are predictable, so I like to add a little chaos to every situation.
I throw my weight around to make sure I get my way.
I enjoy breaking delicate works of art. And fingers, which are sort of the same.
Death comes for everyone, so take as much pleasure as you can from every moment of life.
I strive to find more ways to express my art through painâ€”my own as well as others'.
People are inspired by the greatness they see in art.
I have belonged to the same performance troupe for years, and these people mean everything to me.
My family is prominent in another guild. I enjoy my wild life, but I don't want to embarrass them.
I couldn't hide my emotions and opinions even if I wanted to.
I resent the rich and powerful.
When I'm angry, I lash out in violence.
There's no such thing as too much pleasure.
I never raise my voice or lose my temper.
I feel the pains and joys of everyone around me, friend or foe.
I would rather make a friend than thwart an enemy.
I'm always straining to peer into another reality that seems to be just beyond my senses.
I'm uneasy if I can't see plants growing or feel soil beneath my feet.
Seeing illness or injury in any creature saddens me.
I have much to be proud of, but I am still just one strand in the grand, interwoven tapestry of life.

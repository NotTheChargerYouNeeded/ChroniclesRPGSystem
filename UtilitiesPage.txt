Hello

This is the page where I will put different tools that might help you guys.
The primary one right now is the Chronicles Calculator. It's listed under Chron Calc.
It has a few input boxes but they don't have a label right now. They are, from left to right:
Advantages, Buff1, Buff2, Buff3, Check Dice, Debuff1, Debuff2, Debuff3, Disadvantages
You can leave whichever ones on zero and it will calculate apropriately.
Everything except Advantages and Disadvantages defaults to a number of four at maximum.
The calculator keeps track of previous Acts, which are increased by one when you press te Act button instead of the Check button.
The Check button will make a check without considering disadvantages due to previous acts.
The Act button will make a check and add disadvantages equal to previous acts.
Advantages and Disadvantages automatically cancel each other out in the calculation.
